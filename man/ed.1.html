<p class="Pp"><code class="Nm">ed</code> is a line-oriented text editor. It is
    used to create, display, modify, and otherwise manipulate text files. If
    invoked with a <var class="Ar">file</var> argument, then a copy of
    <var class="Ar">file</var> is read into the editor's buffer. Changes are
    made to this copy and not directly to <var class="Ar">file</var> itself.
    Upon quitting <code class="Nm">ed</code>, any changes not explicitly saved
    with a <code class="Ic">w</code> command are lost.</p>
<p class="Pp" id="command">Editing is done in two distinct modes:
    <a class="permalink" href="#command"><i class="Em">command</i></a> and
    <a class="permalink" href="#input"><i class="Em" id="input">input</i></a>.
    When first invoked, <code class="Nm">ed</code> is in command mode. In this
    mode, commands are read from the standard input and executed to manipulate
    the contents of the editor buffer.</p>
<p class="Pp">A typical command might look like:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd Bd-indent"><code class="Li">,s/old/new/g</code></div>
<p class="Pp">which replaces all occurrences of the string &quot;old&quot; with
    &quot;new&quot;.</p>
<p class="Pp">When an input command, such as <code class="Ic">a</code> (append),
    <code class="Ic">i</code> (insert), or <code class="Ic">c</code> (change) is
    given, <code class="Nm">ed</code> enters input mode. This is the primary
    means of adding text to a file. In this mode, no commands are available;
    instead, the standard input is written directly to the editor buffer. Lines
    consist of text up to and including a newline character. Input mode is
    terminated by entering a single period
    (&#x2018;<code class="Li">.</code>&#x2019;) on a line.</p>
<p class="Pp">All <code class="Nm">ed</code> commands operate on whole lines or
    ranges of lines; e.g., the <code class="Ic">d</code> command deletes lines;
    the <code class="Ic">m</code> command moves lines, and so on. It is possible
    to modify only a portion of a line by means of replacement, as in the
    example above. However, even here, the <code class="Ic">s</code> command is
    applied to whole lines at a time.</p>
<p class="Pp">In general, <code class="Nm">ed</code> commands consist of zero or
    more line addresses, followed by a single character command and possibly
    additional parameters; i.e., commands have the structure:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd
  Bd-indent">[<var class="Ar">address</var>[,<var class="Ar">address</var>]]<var class="Ar">command</var>[<var class="Ar">parameters</var>]</div>
<p class="Pp">The address(es) indicate the line or range of lines to be affected
    by the command. If fewer addresses are given than the command accepts, then
    default addresses are supplied.</p>
<p class="Pp">Many <code class="Nm">ed</code> commands and line addresses
    support basic regular expressions (BREs). See <a class="Xr">re_format(7)</a>
    for more information on regular expressions.</p>
<p class="Pp">The options are as follows:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><code class="Fl">-</code></dt>
  <dd>Same as the <code class="Fl">-s</code> option (deprecated).</dd>
  <dt id="p"><a class="permalink" href="#p"><code class="Fl">-p</code></a>
    <var class="Ar">string</var></dt>
  <dd>Specifies a command prompt. This may be toggled on and off with the
      <code class="Ic">P</code> command.</dd>
  <dt id="s"><a class="permalink" href="#s"><code class="Fl">-s</code></a></dt>
  <dd>Suppress diagnostics. This should be used if <code class="Nm">ed</code>
      standard input is from a script.</dd>
  <dt><var class="Ar">file</var></dt>
  <dd>Specifies the name of a file to read. If <var class="Ar">file</var> is
      prefixed with a bang (&#x2018;<code class="Li">!</code>&#x2019;), then it
      is interpreted as a shell command. In this case, what is read is the
      standard output of <var class="Ar">file</var> executed via
      <a class="Xr">sh(1)</a>. To read a file whose name begins with a bang,
      prefix the name with a backslash
      (&#x2018;<code class="Li">\</code>&#x2019;). The default filename is set
      to <var class="Ar">file</var> only if it is not prefixed with a bang.</dd>

<h2 class="Ss" id="LINE_ADDRESSING"><a class="permalink" href="#LINE_ADDRESSING">LINE
  ADDRESSING</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">An address represents the number of a line in the buffer.
    <code class="Nm">ed</code> maintains a
    <a class="permalink" href="#current"><i class="Em" id="current">current
    address</i></a> which is typically supplied to commands as the default
    address when none is specified. When a file is first read, the current
    address is set to the last line of the file. In general, the current address
    is set to the last line affected by a command.</p>
<p class="Pp">A line address is constructed from one of the bases in the list
    below, optionally followed by a numeric offset. The offset may include any
    combination of digits, operators (e.g.,
    &#x2018;<code class="Li">+</code>&#x2019;,
    &#x2018;<code class="Li">-</code>&#x2019;, and
    &#x2018;<code class="Li">^</code>&#x2019;), and whitespace. Addresses are
    read from left to right, and their values are computed relative to the
    current address.</p>
<p class="Pp">One exception to the rule that addresses represent line numbers is
    the address <span class="Ad">0</span> (zero). This means &#x201C;before the
    first line&#x201D;, and is legal wherever it makes sense.</p>
<p class="Pp">An address range is two addresses separated either by a comma or
    semi-colon. The value of the first address in a range cannot exceed the
    value of the second. If only one address is given in a range, then the
    second address is set to the given address. If an
    <var class="Ar">n</var>-tuple of addresses is given where
    <var class="Ar">n</var> &gt; 2, then the corresponding range is determined
    by the last two addresses in the <var class="Ar">n</var>-tuple. If only one
    address is expected, then the last address is used.</p>
<p class="Pp">Each address in a comma-delimited range is interpreted relative to
    the current address. In a semi-colon-delimited range, the first address is
    used to set the current address, and the second address is interpreted
    relative to the first.</p>
<p class="Pp">The following address symbols are recognized:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>.</dt>
  <dd>The current line (address) in the buffer.</dd>
  <dt>$</dt>
  <dd>The last line in the buffer.</dd>
  <dt><var class="Ar">n</var></dt>
  <dd>The <var class="Ar">n</var>th line in the buffer, where
      <var class="Ar">n</var> is a number in the range
      <span class="Ad">[0,$]</span>.</dd>
  <dt>- or ^</dt>

    ^<var class="Ar">n</var></dt>
  <dd>The <var class="Ar">n</var>th previous line, where <var class="Ar">n</var>
      is a non-negative number.</dd>
  <dt>+</dt>
  <dd>The next line. This is equivalent to <span class="Ad">+1</span> and may be
      repeated with cumulative effect.</dd>
  <dt>+<var class="Ar">n</var></dt>
  <dd>The <var class="Ar">n</var>th next line, where <var class="Ar">n</var> is
      a non-negative number.</dd>
  <dt>, or %</dt>
  <dd>The first through last lines in the buffer. This is equivalent to the
      address range <span class="Ad">1,$</span>.</dd>
  <dt>;</dt>
  <dd>The current through last lines in the buffer. This is equivalent to the
      address range <span class="Ad">.,$</span>.</dd>
  <dt>/<var class="Ar">re</var>/</dt>
  <dd>The next line containing the regular expression <var class="Ar">re</var>.
      The search wraps to the beginning of the buffer and continues down to the
      current line, if necessary. The second slash can be omitted if it ends a
      line. &quot;//&quot; repeats the last search.</dd>
  <dt>?<var class="Ar">re</var>?</dt>
  <dd>The previous line containing the regular expression
      <var class="Ar">re</var>. The search wraps to the end of the buffer and
      continues up to the current line, if necessary. The second question mark
      can be omitted if it ends a line. &quot;??&quot; repeats the last
    search.</dd>
  <dt>'<var class="Ar">lc</var></dt>
  <dd>The line previously marked by a <code class="Ic">k</code> (mark) command,
      where <var class="Ar">lc</var> is a lower case letter.</dd>

<h2 class="Ss" id="COMMANDS"><a class="permalink" href="#COMMANDS">COMMANDS</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">All <code class="Nm">ed</code> commands are single characters,

    with a backslash (&#x2018;<code class="Li">\</code>&#x2019;).</p>
<p class="Pp">In general, at most one command is allowed per line. However, most
    commands accept a print suffix, which is any of <code class="Ic">p</code>
    (print), <code class="Ic">l</code> (list), or <code class="Ic">n</code>
    (enumerate), to print the last line affected by the command.</p>
<p class="Pp"><code class="Nm">ed</code> recognizes the following commands. The

<p class="Pp">Since the <code class="Ic">g</code> (global) command masks any
    errors from failed searches and substitutions, it can be used to perform

<div class="Bd Bd-indent"><code class="Li">g/old/s//new/</code></div>

<p class="Pp">If diagnostics are not disabled, attempting to quit
    <code class="Nm">ed</code> or edit another file before writing a modified
    buffer results in an error. If the command is entered a second time, it
