<p class="Pp">This document attempts to list items for the system administrator
    to check and set up after installation and first boot of the system. A basic
    knowledge of <span class="Ux">UNIX</span> systems is assumed.</p>

<h2 class="Ss" id="Updates"><a class="permalink" href="#Updates">Updates</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">By the time you have installed the system, it is possible that
    important security updates or critical bug fixes were released, it is
    therefore recommended to check and upgrade if necessary by using the
    <a class="Xr">apt(8)</a> or <a class="Xr">apt-get(8)</a> commands.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Doas"><a class="permalink" href="#Doas">Doas</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Ragnarok comes with doas, an alternative to sudo. In order to
    work, doas needs to be properly configured in /etc/doas.conf. For example,
    to allow members of the wheel group to run commands with doas, simply run
    the</p>
<p class="Pp"><code class="Cm">echo 'permit :wheel' &gt;
  /etc/doas.conf</code></p>
<p class="Pp">command. To allow only a single user, replace ':wheel' with your
    user name.</p>
<p class="Pp">For more configuration options, refer to the official
    <a class="Xr">doas(1)</a> documentation.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Firewall"><a class="permalink" href="#Firewall">Firewall</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">The default firewall in Ragnarok is nftables. The default
    configuration blocks all incoming connections, except for those established
    by the user, and allows outgoing traffic.</p>
<p class="Pp">It is good practice to inspect /etc/nftables.conf and further lock
    it down if need be. For example, disabling ICMP and IPv6, as long as the
    user understands (and can live with) the potential drawbacks in doing
  so.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Networking"><a class="permalink" href="#Networking">Networking</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Ragnarok uses the <a class="Xr">ifup(1)</a> and
    <a class="Xr">ifdown(1)</a> commands to connect to network interfaces
    configured in <span class="Pa">/etc/network/interfaces.</span>
    <a class="Xr">wpasupplicant(1)</a> is used in the background to handle
    connecting to protected WPA* wifi networks.</p>
<p class="Pp">Wired connections should be configured automatically at install
    time. Wireless interfaces should be configured in
    <span class="Pa">/etc/network/interfaces.d/interface-name</span></p>
<p class="Pp">The interface name can be found with the</p>
<p class="Pp"><code class="Cm">find /sys/class/net</code></p>
<p class="Pp">command. The wireless interface should begin with 'wlp'. A simple
    config file for a wireless interface (hereby named wlp1s0) would look as
    such:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd Bd-indent">allow-hotplug wlp1s0</div>
<div class="Bd Bd-indent">iface wlp1s0 inet dhcp</div>
<div class="Bd Bd-indent">wpa-ssid MYSSID</div>
<div class="Bd Bd-indent">wpa-psk MYWIFIPASSWORD</div>
<p class="Pp">This will suffice for a single interface which will be started at
    boot time.</p>
<p class="Pp">For security reasons, it is highly recommended to run the</p>
<p class="Pp"><code class="Cm">chmod 0600
    /etc/network/interfaces.d/interface-name</code></p>
<p class="Pp">command to prevent non-root users from reading the file.</p>
<p class="Pp">For more information on configuring and connecting to networks,
    refer to the <a class="Xr">interfaces(5)</a>, <a class="Xr">ifup(1)</a> and
    <a class="Xr">ifdown(1)</a> manual pages.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="System_Time"><a class="permalink" href="#System_Time">System
  Time</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">In some cases, the <span class="Pa">hwclock.sh</span> script does
    the job setting the system clock at boot. However, if system time goes out
    of sync, a proper NTP daemon should be installed. Ragnarok does not come
    with one by default, at least not in the 01 version, but NTPsec, Chrony or
    OpenNTPD are highly recommended and available in the repositories.</p>

<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="System_Mail"><a class="permalink" href="#System_Mail">System
  Mail</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Ragnarok ships with <a class="Xr">bsd-mailx(1)</a> and
    <a class="Xr">dma(8)</a> for its default mailing system. It is advised to
    get familiar with it as it is used by the system to communicate with
  users.</p>
<p class="Pp">To read mail sent to root without loging into its account, it is
    useful to create/edit <span class="Pa">/etc/aliases</span> and alias root's
    mail to the default user created at install time:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd Bd-indent">root:	username</div>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="bsd-mailx"><a class="permalink" href="#bsd-mailx">bsd-mailx</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">The traditional simple command-line-mode mail user agent (from the
    OpenBSD project) which provides the <code class="Cm">/usr/bin/mail</code>
    command. It does not include any of the features provided by more advanced
    mail user agents. See the <a class="Xr">bsd-mailx(1)</a> manual page for
    further information.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="dma"><a class="permalink" href="#dma">dma</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">The Dragonfly Mail Agent is a simple Mail Transport Agent from the
    DragonflyBSD project. It was chosen for Ragnarok's default MTA due to its
    simplicity and the fact that it does not listen on any port, ever. It
    accepts mails from local Mail User Agents (MUA) and delivers them either to
    local mailboxes or remote SMTP servers. Remote delivery includes support for
    features such as TLS/SSL and SMTP authentication.</p>
<p class="Pp">dma is not intended as a replacement for full-featured MTAs. If
    such an MTA is needed, it is recommended to install something more
    appropriate, such as OpenSMTPD, which is the only other MTA fully supported
    by the Ragnarok project.</p>
<p class="Pp">For more information on dma see the <a class="Xr">dma(8)</a>,
    <a class="Xr">mailq(8)</a>, <a class="Xr">newaliases(8)</a>, and
    <a class="Xr">sendmail(8)</a> manual pages.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Cron"><a class="permalink" href="#Cron">Cron</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">The <span class="Pa">/etc/cron.*</span> directories contain
    various cron jobs for system maintenance. On systems that will not be always
    powered on, you can either install the <a class="Xr">anacron(8)</a> package
    or handle them manually. For example, you could change the
    <span class="Pa">/etc/crontab</span> file to run the cron jobs at a time
    when you know the system will be powered on. However, it is better to use
    the <code class="Cm">crontab -e</code> command to enable the individual jobs
    that are needed, such as
    <span class="Pa">/etc/cron.daily/update-manpages</span>.</p>
<p class="Pp">For more details, see the <a class="Xr">cron(8)</a>,
    <a class="Xr">crontab(1)</a>, and <a class="Xr">crontab(5)</a> manuals.</p>
