<h2 class="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="permalink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">This document attempts to give as much information as possible
    about Ragnarok's live environment. The idea is to give a quick rundown of
    the tools available by default so that users can get familiar with the
    system in the most straightforward fashion.</p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h2 class="Sh" id="X_SESSION"><a class="permalink" href="#X_SESSION">X

<section class="Ss">
<h3 class="Ss" id="Starting_an_Xsession"><a class="permalink" href="#Starting_an_Xsession">Starting
  an Xsession</a></h3>
<p class="Pp">If not done already, you can start X11 by issuing the
    <a class="Xr">startx(1)</a> command.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h3 class="Ss" id="Window_Manager"><a class="permalink" href="#Window_Manager">Window
  Manager</a></h3>
<p class="Pp">Ragnarok includes two window managers: <a class="Xr">Raven(1)</a>,
    a fork of Suckless' dwm, which is the default when logging into X, and
    <a class="Xr">cwm(1)</a>, from the OpenBSD project. Using cwm is as simple
    as changing the WM variable in <span class="Pa">~/.xinitrc</span> from
    &quot;raven&quot; to &quot;cwm&quot; and (re)starting X.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h3 class="Ss" id="raven"><a class="permalink" href="#raven">raven</a></h3>
<p class="Pp">The version of dwm included has been patched to add the
    bottomstack, leftstack and deck layouts. It also includes gaps in all
    layouts (including monocle). Layouts can be set per tag and an option to
    increase/decrease the height of the bar is also available.</p>
<p class="Pp">This version of dwm does not support launching applications via
    keybindings set in its config file (see the
    <a class="Sx" href="#Keyboard_Shortcuts">Keyboard Shortcuts</a> section for
    more details), only window and tag manipulations get handled by the window
    manager's internal keyboard shortcuts. For a list of keybindings supported
    by the window manager, see either the
    <span class="Pa">/usr/src/dwm/config.h</span> file, or hit the alt+shift+?
    keyboard shortcut to display the list in vim.</p>
<p class="Pp">Basic system information (memory usage, cpu load, network
    connection status, volume level and date/time) is displayed to the right
    inside the status bar. This information is set by the
    <span class="Pa">/usr/local/bin/statusbar.sh</span> script.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h3 class="Ss" id="cwm"><a class="permalink" href="#cwm">cwm</a></h3>
<p class="Pp">Calm Window Manager, from the OpenBSD project, is also available
    in the base system. The live environment includes a custom
    <span class="Pa">~/.cwmrc</span> config file, and a status bar is drawn at
    the top of the screen, using a custom script (
    <span class="Pa">/usr/local/bin/cwmbar</span> ) piped to
    <a class="Xr">lemonbar(1)</a>.</p>
<p class="Pp">Much like raven, cwm's config file does not set keyboard shortcuts
    to open applications, only for window and group manipulation. Available
    keybindings for cwm can be viewed in .cwmrc or by hitting the alt+shift+?
    keyboard shortcut.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h3 class="Ss" id="Terminal_Emulator"><a class="permalink" href="#Terminal_Emulator">Terminal
  Emulator</a></h3>
<p class="Pp">The default terminal in Ragnarok is <a class="Xr">rt(1)</a>, a
    lightly patched fork of Suckless' st. Since it is meant to provide a minimal
    terminal for <a class="Xr">tmux(1)</a>, rt does not come with much features,
    since tmux already provides them. The two patches applied are for cosmetic
    purposes, allowing a transparent background and configuration through the
    <span class="Pa">~/.Xresources</span> file.</p>
<p class="Pp"><a class="Xr">xterm(1)</a> is also provided, with it's own theming
    in Xresources.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h3 class="Ss" id="Keyboard_Shortcuts"><a class="permalink" href="#Keyboard_Shortcuts">Keyboard
  Shortcuts</a></h3>
<p class="Pp">The <a class="Xr">sxhkd(1)</a> program is provided with a set of
    default keybindings to open programs in
    <span class="Pa">~/.config/sxhkd/sxhkdrc</span>. This means that all
    program-related shortcuts will work regardless of the window manager being
    used.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h3 class="Ss" id="Extra_Software"><a class="permalink" href="#Extra_Software">Extra
  Software</a></h3>
<p class="Pp">The live iso also provides all other programs included in
    Ragnarok's xserv package set: <a class="Xr">xcompmgr(1)</a>,
    <a class="Xr">xclip(1)</a>, <a class="Xr">hsetroot(1)</a>,
    <a class="Xr">dunst(1)</a>.</p>
<p class="Pp">Many programs not available in a standard Ragnarok base system are
    also added for a more complete experience, among them:
    <a class="Xr">vifm(1)</a>, <a class="Xr">mpv(1)</a>,
    <a class="Xr">nsxiv(1)</a>, <a class="Xr">scrot(1)</a>.</p>
</section>

<section class="Sh">
<h2 class="Sh" id="SYSTEM_ADMINISTRATION"><a class="permalink" href="#SYSTEM_ADMINISTRATION">SYSTEM
  ADMINISTRATION</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Since this is a live system, there isn't much in the way of system
    administration. However, a few things may be of interest.</p>
<section class="Ss">
<h3 class="Ss" id="Networking"><a class="permalink" href="#Networking">Networking</a></h3>
<p class="Pp">Wired network connections should be properly set at boot time, but
    wireless networks will have to be configured manually. The Ragnarok live iso
    includes a small script to quickly setup an interface file to use with
    <a class="Xr">wpasupplicant(1)</a>, called <span class="Pa">addwifi</span>.
    With root privileges, simply run the command:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd Bd-indent"><code class="Li">doas addwifi.sh</code></div>
<p class="Pp">and answer the questions. After completion, the interface file
    will be located in
    <span class="Pa">/etc/network/interfaces.d/&lt;interface-name&gt;</span>.
    For security reasons, the file can only be read with root privileges.
    Afterwards, you can connect to the network using the ifup command:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd Bd-indent"><code class="Li">doas ifup
  &lt;interface-name&gt;</code></div>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h3 class="Ss" id="security_updates"><a class="permalink" href="#security_updates">security
  updates</a></h3>
<p class="Pp">The live iso is rebuilt whenever the kernel receives a security
    update. However, other programs may have been updated since the iso's
    release and should still be updated even if running a live system
    (particularly web browsers). It is important to run the
    <a class="Xr">apt-get</a> commands to update the base system as soon as an
    internet connection is established.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h3 class="Ss" id="Firewall"><a class="permalink" href="#Firewall">Firewall</a></h3>
<p class="Pp">The base system comes with nftables installed and enabled by
    default, using a sane configuration file which blocks all incoming and
    forwarded connections by default. If one wishes to modify the default
    configuration, then simply edit the
    <span class="Pa">/etc/nftables.conf</span> file and restart the service with
    the following command</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd Bd-indent"><code class="Li"># service nftables
  restart</code></div>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h3 class="Ss" id="System_mail"><a class="permalink" href="#System_mail">System
  mail</a></h3>
<p class="Pp">You can read system mail by entering the <a class="Xr">mail(1)</a>
    command. Selecting the mail to read is done by typing it's number then
    Return. Quit mail by typing q then Return. You can delete read messages by
    typing d then Return before quitting.</p>
</section>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h2 class="Sh" id="WEB_BROWSING"><a class="permalink" href="#WEB_BROWSING">WEB
  BROWSING</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">The live system includes Suckless' <a class="Xr">surf(1)</a>
    browser along with a wrapper script called <span class="Pa">bro.sh</span>.
    For details on bro.sh usage, simply enter the following command:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd Bd-indent"><code class="Li">$ bro.sh -h</code></div>
<p class="Pp">Note: basic ad blocking for surf is achieved by using Steven
    Black's unified hosts file. The hosts file can be updated by running the
    'hostsupdate' command as a non-root user.</p>
<section class="Ss">
<h3 class="Ss" id="Other_browsers"><a class="permalink" href="#Other_browsers">Other
  browsers</a></h3>
<p class="Pp">Surf is only recommended as a web page viewer rather than as a
    full fledged web browser. Any browser available in Debian can also be
    installed via <a class="Xr">apt-get(1)</a>.</p>
