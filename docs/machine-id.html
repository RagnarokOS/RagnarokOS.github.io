			<h1>On regenerating the machine-id every boot</h1>
			<hr>

			<p>
			The <i>/etc/machine-id</i> and <i>/var/lib/dbus/machine-id</i> files can potentially be used
			to fingerprint a system over the long term. Ragnarok provides a simple solution to that problem
			by regenerating this ID every boot through a simple init script[1] that removes the file during
			the shutdown process. Of course, mitigating the potential issues caused by the machine-id is not
			unique to Ragnarok (Devuan, Whonix and Tails do it one way or another as well).
			</p>

			<h2>The Debate</h2>
			<hr>
			<p>
			As with many things in the Linux world (especially when it comes to projects such as systemd and
			dbus), the existence of these two files have sparked a few heated arguments. Some may argue that
			any concern over this unique machine-id is merely FUD, while others may believe that their mere
			existence constitutes a deliberate violation of user privacy to the profit of malicious actors.
			</p>

			<p>
			As always, the truth probably lies in the middle. Indeed, there is no indication of anyone, or
			anything, actively using these files for obviously malicious reasons. That said, the mere fact
			that they are world-readable (by necessity) and that any program, at any point in time,
			<u>could potentially</u> use them for such purpose does mean that taking steps to mitigate the
			issue is not a bad idea. Furthermore, the idea that mitigating this potential problem is 
			<i>"pointless since there are other things on a user's system that can be used for fingerprinting"</i>
			is fallacious. If Ragnarok followed that train of thought, it would have no reason to exist. 
			In fact, if most people agreed with this fallacy, there would be no point in ever securing or
			making a system more private, since there will, obviously, always be ways that security and
			privacy can be compromised.
			</p>

			<p>
			In any case, Ragnarok exists in great part to implement, and experiment with, different security
			and/or privacy features, even if they may be seen as partially or completely redundant.
			</p>

			<h2>Potential Issues</h2>
			<hr>
			<p>
			The d-bus specification[2] states that:
			<blockquote>
				This UUID must be the same for all processes on a single system at least until that system
				next reboots. It should be the same across reboots if possible, but this is not always 
				possible to implement and is not guaranteed.
			</blockquote>
			</p>

			<p>
			Well-designed programs that uses the machine-id file should take dbus' specification into account, and
			Ragnarok's (admittedly opinionated) position is that any program relying on having a machine-id that
			remains the same across reboots is flawed. This position will not change, regardless of the
			argument.
			</p>

			<p>
			Of course, being part of the dbus specification does not mean all programs will take that into account.
			One such program is systemd-journald, which relies on an unchanging machine-id to function properly.
			</p>

			<p>
			Although a default Ragnarok install uses sysvinit and does not make use of systemd-journald, it is possible
			to use Ragnarok with systemd (or any other init system). Taking this into account, as well as taking into
			account that Ragnarok users should have the freedom to decide how system parts behave, is why machine-id is
			regenerated with an init script. This script can simply be disabled if the user wants, or needs, to keep
			a constant machine-id file.
			</p>

			<p>
			Providing an easy way to disable machine-id regeneration is as far as Ragnarok will go on the matter. It is
			advised to stay away from programs that don't behave properly if one does not want to disable this feature.
