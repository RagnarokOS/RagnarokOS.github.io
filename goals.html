	<strong><a href="index.html">Ragnarok</a></strong> &mdash; <i>Simple, Unix-like, and Hardened by default.</i>
	</p>

	<h1>Project Goals</h1>

	<p>
	The project's explicitly stated goal is to provide a simple and hardened Debian-based system
	that is suitable as a daily driver. This, however, is only the tip of the proverbial iceberg.
	</p>

	<p>
	At its core, Ragnarok is merely a modified Debian and all modifications should, as much as possible,
	be applicable on top of any Debian (or derivative) system without causing too much disruption, unless
	desired by the user.
	</p>

	<h2>Guidelines</h2>

	<p>To stay in line with its goals, Ragnarok abides by the following guidelines:</p>

	<ul>
		<li>Any changes made to the standard Debian system should be well documented.</li>
		<li>Provide a deb package for any software created or maintained by the project.</li>
		<li>It should be possible to enable Ragnarok's package repository on any Debian system
			(and derivatives) without disrupting the user's installation.<br>
		To do so, an apt_preferences(5) file should be provided in order to prevent
		Ragnarok's repository from overriding the default Debian one if the user does not want it to.<br>
		For more details, see the quick note
		<a href="docs/duplicate-packages">on the subject of duplicate packages</a>.</li>
		<li>All tools developed by the project should be usable either together, or on their own</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>Ragnarok's Infrastructure</h2>

	<p>It's important to note that these tools and the automation process do not exist to provide a lower
	level of entry, but as a means to relieve maintenance burden and provide easily reproducible builds.
	This means that prior knowledge of Unix system administration, of the tools provided by Ragnarok and
	the software that these tools make use of, is expected. In the absence of prior knowledge, a will to
	learn is going to be mandatory.
	</p>

	<p>
	It is the project's opinion that the best way to make "beginner friendly" software is to provide 
	good/detailed documentation, rather than including too many layers of abstraction which usually
	result in taking control away from the user.
	</p>
