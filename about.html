	<h1>About Ragnarok</h1>
	<hr>
	<p>Ragnarok is a Debian-based Linux&reg; distribution whose purpose is to be small, simple, Unix-like and hardened by default.
	One of its core principle is to provide a fully functional base system while remaining as minimal as possible.</p>

	<p>To that end, Ragnarok is built upon a Debian 'minbase' variant and the full system is divided in "sets" (or metapackages)
	which can be cherry-picked upon system installation. Only the 'base' set is mandatory, while all others (devel, xserv, xprogs,
	xfonts, virt) are optional.</p>

	<p><i>Note that the base system does not include extra programs such as web browsers, video players, files
		managers, etc. It is up to the user to install what is desired.</i></p>

	<h2>Development Guidelines</h2>
	<hr>
	<p>The project is developed while abiding to the following guidelines:</p>

	<ul>
		<li>Ragnarok's stable branch follows Debian stable, but new security features may be
			added about every six months, provided they were thouroughly tested.</li>
		<li>The build infrastructure should be as straighforward as possible, and easily extendible
			so that it can be used to create customized installs.</li>
		<li>Use packages from the Debian repository as is, as much as possible, but rebuild if necessary.</li>
		<li>If a package needs to be rebuilt, fetch the source from Debian whenever possible,
			but don't hesitate to fetch from upstream if necessary.</li>
		<li>Document any changes made to Debian sources, including if/when a patch was reverted.</li>
		<li>A lack of documentation should be considered a bug.</li>
		<li>Treat security as a first-class citizen and don't hesitate testing new security features
		in the development branch (-current).</li>
		<li>Support for packages which cannot (or will not) be made compatible with the base
			system should be removed swiftly.</li>
		<li>All tools developed by the project should be usable either together, or on their own.</li>
		<li>Decisions are made, and contributions accepted, on the basis of their technical merit alone.</li>
	</ul>
