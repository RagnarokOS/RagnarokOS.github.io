	<h1>About Ragnarok</h1>
	<hr>
	<p>
	Ragnarok is a Debian derivative distribution currently under heavy development. The project's
	primary goal is to create a simple, Unix-like, and "hardened by default" distribution suitable
	as a daily driver.
	Still very much in its infancy, Ragnarok's immediate focus is to build a base system entirely
	from scratch, while remaining binary-compatible with the latest Debian stable release.
	</p>

	<h2>Guidelines</h2>
	<hr>
	<p>The project is developed while abiding to the following guidelines:</p>

	<ul>
		<li>Be as independent as (realistically) possible from Debian.</li>
		<li>Ensure the creation of a robust infrastructure which does not rely on Debian
		tools to build and distribute the base system.</li>
		<li>Fetch sources from Debian whenever possible, but don't hesitate to fetch
		from upstream if necessary.</li>
		<li>Document any changes made to Debian sources, including if/when a patch was reverted.</li>
		<li>A lack of documentation should be considered a bug.</li>
		<li>The base system should be treated as a whole and include all that is necessary to have
		a usable Unix-like system out-of-the-box, while remaining minimal.</li>
		<li>Treat security as a first-class citizen and don't hesitate testing new security features
		in the development branch (-current).</li>
		<li>Rebuild third-party packages (those from the Debian repository) if they cause any
		conflict with the base system.</li>
		<li>Support for third-party packages which cannot (or will not) be made
		compatible with the base system should be removed swiftly.</li>
		<li>All tools developed by the project should be usable either together, or on their own.</li>
		<li>Decisions are made, and contributions accepted, on the basis of their technical merit alone.</li>
	</ul>
