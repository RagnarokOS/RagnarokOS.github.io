	<h1>About Ragnarok</h1>
	<hr>
	<p>
	Ragnarok is a Debian derivative distribution currently under heavy development.
	</p>

	<h2>Project Goals</h2>
	<hr>
	<p></p>

	<ul>
		<li>Build a simple, hardened and Unix-like operating system suitable as a daily driver.</li>
		<li>Rebuild all base system packages with LLVM/Clang (where applicable), using
		ThinLTO[1] and enabling extra hardening flags (including Control Flow Integrity[2]).</li>
		<li>Fix all security-related compilation warnings for base system packages.</li>
		<li>Follow Debian's release cycle, but include new security features about every six
		months (after being thoroughly tested). Two years is too long to wait before the stable
		branch can benefit from such improvements.</li>
	</ul>

	</p>

	<h2>Guidelines</h2>
	<hr>
	<p>The project is developed while abiding to the following guidelines:</p>

	<ul>
		<li>Ensure the creation of a robust infrastructure which does not rely on Debian
		tools to build and distribute the base system.</li>
		<li>Fetch sources from Debian whenever possible, but don't hesitate to fetch
		from upstream if necessary.</li>
		<li>Document any changes made to Debian sources, including if/when a patch was reverted.</li>
		<li>A lack of documentation should be considered a bug.</li>
		<li>The base system should be treated as a whole and include all that is necessary to have
		a usable Unix-like system out-of-the-box, while remaining minimal.</li>
		<li>Treat security as a first-class citizen and don't hesitate testing new security features
		in the development branch (-current).</li>
		<li>Rebuild third-party packages (those from the Debian repository) if they cause any
		conflict with the base system.</li>
		<li>Support for third-party packages which cannot (or will not) be made
		compatible with the base system should be removed swiftly.</li>
		<li>All tools developed by the project should be usable either together, or on their own.</li>
		<li>Decisions are made, and contributions accepted, on the basis of their technical merit alone.</li>
	</ul>
