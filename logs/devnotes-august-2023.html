Ragnarok Development Notes
==========================

[2023-08-08]

* Ragnarok will soon move away from using deb packages for the base
  system programs and will instead distribute updates via simple tgz
  archives. Work is currently being done on the sysupdate[1] utility
  to replace the usage of dpkg with the new method. Since the work is
  almost complete, this change should, in theory, be available in the
  next live iso.

* The idea of making Ragnarok an independently built distro using Debian
  sources was set aside for a while, but not abandoned. The above change
  represents one more step in that direction. Just how independent the
  distro will be remains to be seen. It's always possible that while the
  base system will be fully independent, apt/dpkg would still be used to
  install third party packages (from the Debian repo). This is the current
  direction, with an option to eventually drop apt and the Debian repository
  down the line.
