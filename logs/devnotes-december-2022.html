Ragnarok Development Notes
==========================

[2022-12-15]

* There hasn't been much activity in the src repo, but a lot of progress
has been made regardless. More tools were added to bin and usr/bin:

	* (the one true) Awk
	* OpenBSD's ed(1) and sed(1)
	* Plenty of tools from Suckless' sbase.

* sbase's libutil and libutf were added to /lib, with headers in the
usr/includes directory. The libraries had to be separated, and each
tool had to have their own Makefiles created due to how Ragnarok's
source repo is structured, and where each tools are supposed to go
once they are built.

* Many of the tools from sbase are only temporary and will be replaced by
their OpenBSD equivalent. There is nothing wrong with sbase, they are well
written tools that do the job perfectly, but I'm more familiar with the
OpenBSD utilities so they are preferable. The tools from sbase are going
to serve as a "rescue", replacing those that can't be ported from OpenBSD.

* The current priority for OpenBSD tools to be ported are tar/pax, yacc,
m4 and make. It's important to note that the work done by OpenBSD developer
Brian Callahan is making the process of porting OpenBSD's tools a lot easier
and much less time consuming. So, lots of credits goes to him.

* Build scripts from the base system are getting replaced with makefiles.
Using makefiles was the original idea, which had to be dumped in favor
of scripts for a few reasons. Either way, the switch isn't completed yet
so the auto build of the src tree is broken for now.

* Some work has also been made on init scripts. Ragnarok will use sysvinit,
at least at first, with a BSD-style structure, for simplicity's sake.

* Don't expect lots of activity in the repositories this month. It's the 
holidays soon, so things are going slower and more relaxed.
