Ragnarok Development Notes
==========================

[2023-03-19]

* The development environment has finally been moved to Bookworm. Since it
has hit the hard freeze stage, it seemed appropriate to do the change now.

* In the previous notes it was mentionned that the src repository would be
renamed and converted into a ports repo instead. That was a bad idea. The
ports and src repos should be separate, with the src repo hosting the files
and scripts (not exclusive to the ports and iso infrastructures) that will
go into the "ragnarok-files" deb package.

* A tarball of Ragnarok's root filesystem will soon be available. This will
make development a lot easier, and it will eventually be used by the installer
when offline installs are preferred. In short, this rootfs is a simple Debian
minbase plus the ragnarok-files and modified base-files packages, and is
generated with the mmdebstrap tool, rather than debootstrap.

* Speaking of mmdebstrap, it will replace debootstrap wherever possible.
It has a lot of advantages over deboostrap, including the hability to 
use multiple repositories. This has some security benefits since it can
use the debian-security repository while building a system.

* Currently, openrc (with openrc-init) is being tested to see if it can
be a suitable replacement to sysvinit. "Suitable" here means: if it can
be used in the live system without too much hackery, and if the package
remains a 100% reliable. If the testing turns out to be unsuccessful,
then a more bsd-style sysvinit will be used. 

[2023-03-13]

* Lots of things happened since the last dev notes back in December. It was
finally decided to base it off Debian, for many reasons. I don't feel the
need to justify this decision so that's all there is to it.

* The most significant change is the return to the original idea behind the
Ragnarok project: the creation of a set of tools and an infrastructure to
quickly build (and rebuild) heavily customized Debian installs and ISOs.
Ragnarok, the distribution, serves as an example of the type of end product
that can be achieved by using these tools.

* All of Ragnarok's tools and custom packages will be made to be used either
together or standalone. This is one of the top priority currently. Packages
that are maintained by myself (oksh, hardened_malloc and OpenBSD's ed) will
be moved from the src repo to my personal git so that they can be fetched or
cloned in a way that is more convenient for everyone, myself included.

* The src repository will be turned into a ports tree, used to build custom
deb packages either fetched from Debian sources or from upstream. All packages
specific to Ragnarok will be built using this ports system with mkpkg[1], and
as per the project's policy, this ports system can be used standalone on any
Debian system or Debian-based distribution.

* The Ragnarok development version is still based on Debian Bullseye but the
move to Bookworm is fast approaching. The goal is to make Ragnarok's first
stable release as soon as Bookworm becomes stable.

* As far as the future of Ragnarok's development branch goes, it's still un-
certain whether it'll be based off of Debian testing or sid. Testing would
make the most sense since it's literally the next Debian version, but its
lack of a proper security team and delayed updates is definitely a problem.
The current solution considered is to base the dev branch on Sid, and once
testing gets to the freeze stage, create a "next-stable" branch based on it.
