Ragnarok Development Notes
==========================

[2023-03-13]

* Lots of things happened since the last dev notes back in December. It was
finally decided to base it off Debian, for many reasons. I don't feel the
need to justify this decision so that's all there is to it.

* The most significant change is the return to the original idea behind the
Ragnarok project: the creation of a set of tools and an infrastructure to
quickly build (and rebuild) heavily customized Debian installs and ISOs.
Ragnarok, the distribution, serves as an example of the type of end product
that can be achieved by using these tools.

* All of Ragnarok's tools and custom packages will be made to be used either
together or standalone. This is one of the top priority currently. Packages
that are maintained by myself (oksh, hardened_malloc and OpenBSD's ed) will
be moved from the src repo to my personal git so that they can be fetched or
cloned in a way that is more convenient for everyone, myself included.

* The src repository will be turned into a ports tree, used to build custom
deb packages either fetched from Debian sources or from upstream. All packages
specific to Ragnarok will be built using this ports system with mkpkg[1], and
as per the project's policy, this ports system can be used standalone on any
Debian system or Debian-based distribution.

* The Ragnarok development version is still based on Debian Bullseye but the
move to Bookworm is fast approaching. The goal is to make Ragnarok's first
stable release as soon as Bookworm becomes stable.

* As far as the future of Ragnarok's development branch goes, it's still un-
certain whether it'll be based off of Debian testing or sid. Testing would
make the most sense since it's literally the next Debian version, but its
lack of a proper security team and delayed updates is definitely a problem.
The current solution considered is to base the dev branch on Sid, and once
testing gets to the freeze stage, create a "next-stable" branch based on it.
