Ragnarok Development Notes
==========================

[2022-11-01]

These are the top priorities starting today.

* All bash scripts in the build system will be converted to ksh. Luckily,
this isn't complicated and for the most part it'll just be a matter of
converting bash-style arrays into their ksh counterpart.

The bash versions of these scripts will be kept around for a bit, in case
they are needed, but ideally, it shouldn't be necessary to maintain two
versions.

* The OpenBSD core utilities (awk, grep, sed, cat, etc..) will be ported
to Ragnarok. Logically, this has to be done before cross-compiling the
toolchain in order to see which programs, if any, rely on options that
are specific to the GNU coreutils at compile time. Most programs don't
make usage of shell scripts at build time, but some do, and those that
break without GNU-specific options in programs like sed/awk/grep will
have to be dealt with first for obvious reasons.

When this is done, it may break certain parts of the base Debian system
used as the development environment, if there are any that rely on GNU-
specific options (e.g. dpkg and the debhelper scripts, perhaps). Maybe
it won't break but either way, this doesn't matter since it's not meant
to be a functional Debian system.

* After this, live-build will no longer work for building the development
iso. Again, many things may break, least of which live-build's own scripts.
This is not a problem because it can't be relied upon indefinitely, but it
does speed up the need to finalize the "non-live-build"-based build scripts
for the devel iso.

This is also the perfect excuse to start making development snapshots which
will be used not just for the iso but also to make the system installable,
though still not procution ready.
