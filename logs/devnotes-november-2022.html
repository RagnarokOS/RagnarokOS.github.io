Ragnarok Development Notes
==========================

[2022-11-10]

* Work on porting OpenBSD's core utilities continue. For the most part
it's easy (cat was a breeze to port), but some (e.g. chmod) require more
work. It's highly likely that Ragnarok's core utilities will be a mix of
OpenBSD's, and suckless' sbase and ubase.

* Porting OpenBSD's utilities and considering using sbase/ubase has led
to the need to build Ragnarok's own libbsd-style library. The logic being
that libbsd is missing certain functions and would have to be patched in
order to include them. This is the perfect opportunity to build Ragnarok's
own library instead. The advantage being full control over the library, as
well as the fact it won't need libtool/automake/autoconf to build.

* I have begun testing the integration of GrapheneOS' hardened_malloc into
Ragnarok. So far it has worked rather well, with only two issues:

	* A Vim crash with a "vim: caught deadly signal bus" message. This
	could very well be a fluke, as I wasn't able to reproduce it, but
	it's worth mentioning. It could also be hardened_malloc doing its
	job well, or it could be completely unrelated and might not ever
	happen again.

	* System shutdown takes a lot longer with hardened_malloc enabled.
	Long enough to be considered unacceptable. However, this was only
	tested in a live environment and it's possible that a live-specific
	service is the root cause. Or that this happens due to how it was
	being tested (lots of recompiling, reinstalling, removing, messing
	around with ld.so.preload and what not).

Overall, if it wasn't for that second issue, hardened_malloc would be fully
ready to be included in the source tree and enabled in the build script.
Either way, Ragnarok <i>will</i> use a hardened malloc implementation, it
only remains to be seen if it'll be GrapheneOS' or something else.

* As always, it's important to note that even if the repositories don't
get updated for a while, it doesn't mean no work is being done. In this
case it's simply because none of the work that has been done in the last
week can be considered ready to be included in the source tree, let alone
ready to be tested in production. Hardened_malloc will be added real soon
to the source tree, but not yet included in the automatic build script.

These are the top priorities starting today.

* All bash scripts in the build system will be converted to ksh. Luckily,
this isn't complicated and for the most part it'll just be a matter of
converting bash-style arrays into their ksh counterpart.

The bash versions of these scripts will be kept around for a bit, in case
they are needed, but ideally, it shouldn't be necessary to maintain two
versions.

* The OpenBSD core utilities (awk, grep, sed, cat, etc..) will be ported
to Ragnarok. Logically, this has to be done before cross-compiling the
toolchain in order to see which programs, if any, rely on options that
are specific to the GNU coreutils at compile time. Most programs don't
make usage of shell scripts at build time, but some do, and those that
break without GNU-specific options in programs like sed/awk/grep will
have to be dealt with first for obvious reasons.

When this is done, it may break certain parts of the base Debian system
used as the development environment, if there are any that rely on GNU-
specific options (e.g. dpkg and the debhelper scripts, perhaps). Maybe
it won't break but either way, this doesn't matter since it's not meant
to be a functional Debian system.

* After this, live-build will no longer work for building the development
iso. Again, many things may break, least of which live-build's own scripts.
This is not a problem because it can't be relied upon indefinitely, but it
does speed up the need to finalize the "non-live-build"-based build scripts
for the devel iso.

This is also the perfect excuse to start making development snapshots which
will be used not just for the iso but also to make the system installable,
though still not procution ready.
