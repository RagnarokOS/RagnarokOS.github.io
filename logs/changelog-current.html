description: changelog for Ragnarok -current
--------------------------------------------
revision 1.5
date: 2023/08/30

* Latest security update for librsvg (from Debian).

* Fixed: mandoc won't output "outdated mandoc.db lacks ..." anymore.
  This occured because the db was updated before programs like dwm
  were built.

* ksh and (OpenBSD's) ed now built from source, rather than using debs.

* Dummy man-db package added: packages that have it as a hard dependency
  won't refuse to install anymore. Functions that uses man-db options
  won't work unless the real package is installed, however. 
--------------------------------------------
revision: 1.4
date: 2023/08/25

* hardened_malloc is now built at boot time, using -march=native. This
  is recommended by upstream to limit performance impacts. Compiling
  during the init phase also does not significantly increase boot times,
  even on old hardware.

* New sysupdate(8) version: sysupdates are no longer distributed through
  deb packages.

* dwm is now installed to /usr/bin rather than /usr/local/bin. The fact
  that this wasn't the default from the start was an omission.

* Suckless' surf is now the default provided browser and firefox-esr was
  removed (can still be installed via apt-get). The switch was done because

  	a) surf is smaller, so it helps trimming down the iso's size a bit.
  	b) a full fledged browser included by default in a simple live iso
	isn't really needed, and in fact, it's better to let the user choose
	which big browser they want to install if they really need one in a
	live session. Not having firefox installed will also save space if
	someone opts to install something else (and space *is* a concern on
	a live iso, especially when used on a system low on RAM).
	c) surf has a fully functional, and rather sane, apparmor profile
	(which is enabled by default).

* To complement surf, a wrapper script called bro.sh was added. For usage
  details, simply type the 'bro.sh -h' command.

* Steven Black's hosts file was added to provide some basic ad blocking for
  surf.
--------------------------------------------
revision: 1.3
date: 2023/08/11

* Updated kernel with latest security fix.
* New packages: libarchive-tools, libbsd-dev.
--------------------------------------------
revision: 1.2
date: 2023/07/30

* Updated kernel with latest security fix from Debian.
* Fixed: Proper exec bits are now set for rcctl.
* Fixed isolinux boot menu still showing (dev) rather than (-current).
* Changed deprecated '~' option to 'stop' in /etc/rsyslog.d/nftables-log.conf.
* New package: RCS (Revision Control System).
--------------------------------------------
revision: 1.1
date: 2023/07/24

* The sysupdate(8) utility has been added.
* Ragnarok's own rc init scripts and inittab are in use.
* New mandoc build, with proper binary names. This means /etc/skel/.aliases
  has been removed. It can still be used to create aliases for ksh.
* /usr/lib/hardened_malloc.so now points to the light variant. This gives a
  slight performance boost on old (eg. pre-2012) hardware while still being
  more secure than no hardened memory allocator.
* Fixed: manual page path in wmutils core was not properly set, causing them
  to be installed in /usr/man rather than /usr/share/man.
* The bsdextrautils package was added to base. It was absent due to an omission.
