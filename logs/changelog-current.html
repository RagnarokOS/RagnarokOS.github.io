description: changelog for Ragnarok -current
--------------------------------------------
revision: 1.7
date: 2023/09/09
* LLVM/Clang is now installed via the LLVM project's repository in order
  to get version 16 (the latest 'major release') which is not in the repo
  for Debian Bookworm. This will allow building the kernel with Clang's
  Control Flow Integrity, among the other benefits of having an up-to-date
  toolchain.

* New stuff installed from the src repository: sysupdate and the /usr/share
  directory.

* Steven Black's /etc/hosts file was updated to the September 08, 2023 version.
--------------------------------------------
revision: 1.6
date: 2023/09/04

* Major fix: grub.cfg now points to vmlinuz/initrd.img *without* the version
  number appended. This prevented the ISO from booting in EFI mode.

* Programs built from source are now using LLVM/Clang. This means the llvm,
  clang and lld packages were added and are used by default in Ragnarok when
  compiling software.

* usr/bin from Ragnarok's src repository was added to the buildsrc hook,
  which means more programs built from source (no deb): doas(1), signify(1),
  mandoc(1).

* Along with the above programs, OpenBSD's apply(1) and banner(1) were
  added. Although banner was added only for the fun of it (and it helped
  testing the build infrastructure more), apply can be very useful (see
  its manual page for details).

* Added the 'hostsupdate' script, which allows updating Steven Black's
  hosts file quickly for ad blocking in surf(1).
--------------------------------------------
revision: 1.5
date: 2023/08/30

* Latest security update for librsvg (from Debian).

* Fixed: mandoc won't output "outdated mandoc.db lacks ..." anymore.
  This occured because the db was updated before programs like dwm
  were built.

* ksh and (OpenBSD's) ed now built from source, rather than using debs.

* Dummy man-db package added: packages that have it as a hard dependency
  won't refuse to install anymore. Functions that uses man-db options
  won't work unless the real package is installed, however. 
--------------------------------------------
revision: 1.4
date: 2023/08/25

* hardened_malloc is now built at boot time, using -march=native. This
  is recommended by upstream to limit performance impacts. Compiling
  during the init phase also does not significantly increase boot times,
  even on old hardware.

* New sysupdate(8) version: sysupdates are no longer distributed through
  deb packages.

* dwm is now installed to /usr/bin rather than /usr/local/bin. The fact
  that this wasn't the default from the start was an omission.

* Suckless' surf is now the default provided browser and firefox-esr was
  removed (can still be installed via apt-get). The switch was done because

  	a) surf is smaller, so it helps trimming down the iso's size a bit.
  	b) a full fledged browser included by default in a simple live iso
	isn't really needed, and in fact, it's better to let the user choose
	which big browser they want to install if they really need one in a
	live session. Not having firefox installed will also save space if
	someone opts to install something else (and space *is* a concern on
	a live iso, especially when used on a system low on RAM).
	c) surf has a fully functional, and rather sane, apparmor profile
	(which is enabled by default).

* To complement surf, a wrapper script called bro.sh was added. For usage
  details, simply type the 'bro.sh -h' command.

* Steven Black's hosts file was added to provide some basic ad blocking for
  surf.
--------------------------------------------
revision: 1.3
date: 2023/08/11

* Updated kernel with latest security fix.
* New packages: libarchive-tools, libbsd-dev.
--------------------------------------------
revision: 1.2
date: 2023/07/30

* Updated kernel with latest security fix from Debian.
* Fixed: Proper exec bits are now set for rcctl.
* Fixed isolinux boot menu still showing (dev) rather than (-current).
* Changed deprecated '~' option to 'stop' in /etc/rsyslog.d/nftables-log.conf.
* New package: RCS (Revision Control System).
--------------------------------------------
revision: 1.1
date: 2023/07/24

* The sysupdate(8) utility has been added.
* Ragnarok's own rc init scripts and inittab are in use.
* New mandoc build, with proper binary names. This means /etc/skel/.aliases
  has been removed. It can still be used to create aliases for ksh.
* /usr/lib/hardened_malloc.so now points to the light variant. This gives a
  slight performance boost on old (eg. pre-2012) hardware while still being
  more secure than no hardened memory allocator.
* Fixed: manual page path in wmutils core was not properly set, causing them
  to be installed in /usr/man rather than /usr/share/man.
* The bsdextrautils package was added to base. It was absent due to an omission.
