Ragnarok Development Notes
==========================

[2023-04-03]

* The dummy packages built with equivs have been moved to the ports tree.
There's no point in having it in a separate repository.

* The ports system is being improved significantly. The "r-build" files
will no longer be executable scripts and will only contain functions
passed to mkpkg at build time. This is the right way of doing it.

* The testing of openrc/openrc-init didn't last long since a system upgrade
pretty much borked it. Either way, I really wanted to do a bsd-style sysv
implementation so it was the perfect excuse to do just that.

In fact, the bsd-style init scripts are finished, tested, and confirmed to
work wonderfully (and boots slightly faster, if that matters) and what
remains to be done is finish the control script to start/restart/stop/
enable/disable init scripts.

However, this init style will probably not be part of Ragnarok's first stable
release, since it should be more thoroughly tested with multiple setups before
including it.
