Ragnarok Development Notes
==========================

[2023-05-08]

* Shell aliases for mandoc are now handled through a '~/.aliases' file
instead of ~/.profile. The file is sourced via both ksh and bash's rc
files. This is the best solution.

* The ragnarok-files package now provides the /etc/logrotate.d/nftables
config which will rotate nftable's log to avoid it getting too big.

* New init script added: /etc/init.d/rm-machineid[3], which runs during
the halt or reboot phases only. This script deletes /var/lib/dbus/machine-id
and /etc/machine-id (if it exists) at shutdown time, prompting dbus to create
a new one at boot. This offers many advantages. For context and more details,
see the doc[4].

* Suckless' st was properly forked and named rt[5] to avoid having duplicate
binaries on a user's system (for those who wish to use their own st builds),
and because it adds some patches, so this is not standard st. Ragnarok's rt
is explicitly made to provide a minimal terminal for tmux, so it does not
have many features. The only extra features compared to st are:

	* The alpha patch is applied.
	* Config can be done through .Xresources. A slightly modified st-xresources
	patch was used for that. The modifications made are related to color values
	which were wrong in the original patch (probably due to being made for a
	prior version of st).

* Speaking of forking st, its manual page was rewritten using the mdoc[6] format.
Ragnarok's policy is that all manual page created or modified by the project
should use this format, without exception.
