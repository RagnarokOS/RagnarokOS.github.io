Changes in the 2023-07-24 build of the live iso
===============================================

* The sysupdate(8) utility has been added.
* Ragnarok's own rc init scripts and inittab are in use.
* New mandoc build, with proper binary names. This means /etc/skel/.aliases
  has been removed. It can still be used to create aliases for ksh.
* /usr/lib/hardened_malloc.so now points to the light variant. This gives a
  slight performance boost on old (eg. pre-2012) hardware while still being
  more secure than no hardened memory allocator.
* Fixed: manual page path in wmutils core was not properly set, causing them
  to be installed in /usr/man rather than /usr/share/man.
* The bsdextrautils package was added to base. It was absent due to an omission.
