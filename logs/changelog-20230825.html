Changes in the 2023-08-25 build of the live iso
===============================================

* hardened_malloc is now built at boot time, using -march=native. This
  is recommended by upstream to limit performance impacts. Compiling
  during the init phase also does not significantly increase boot times,
  even on old hardware.

* New sysupdate(8) version: sysupdates are no longer distributed through
  deb packages.

* dwm is now installed to /usr/bin rather than /usr/local/bin. The fact
  that this wasn't the default from the start was an omission.

* Suckless' surf is now the default provided browser and firefox-esr was
  removed (can still be installed via apt-get). The switch was done because

  	a) surf is smaller, so it helps trimming down the iso's size a bit.
  	b) a full fledged browser included by default in a simple live iso
	isn't really needed, and in fact, it's better to let the user choose
	which big browser they want to install if they really need one in a
	live session. Not having firefox installed will also save space if
	someone opts to install something else (and space *is* a concern on
	a live iso, especially when used on a system low on RAM).
	c) surf has a fully functional, and rather sane, apparmor profile
	(which is enabled by default).

* To complement surf, a wrapper script called bro.sh was added. For usage
  details, simply type the 'bro.sh -h' command.

* Steven Black's hosts file was added to provide some basic ad blocking for
  surf.
