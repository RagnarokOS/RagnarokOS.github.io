Ragnarok Development Notes
==========================

[2023-06-28]

* The live iso now has a console boot menu entry. This should, in theory,
make it work by default in OpenBSD's vmm/vmd[1][2], though it hasn't been
tested yet. Anyone interested in testing it before I do are more than
welcomed to report back on whether it works as intended or not.

* The next live iso release should include Ragnarok's own rc init scripts
by default. It probably won't make it to the first stable release since it
needs more testing, but for the live iso there are much less concerns.

* Next step will be to finally create the base tarball and all the sets,
at which point a "chroot-style" installation method needs to be documented.
Afterwards, the work on the installer will continue.

* Getting ready to release the live iso. The goal is to create Ragnarok's
own iso-building infrastructure with mmdebstrap + Makefiles, but for now
live-build will be used. Creating an infrastructure from scratch that is
as reliable as live-build will take some time and I have no desire to wait
until it's done before releasing an iso, especially considering that the
system is ready to use and waiting for real life testing.

* Even though live-build is being used for now, the mkiso script is being
replaced with a Makefile already. Once the new infrastructure is finished,
it'll be a simple question of replacing the live build stuff with the new
commands.
