Ragnarok Development Notes
==========================

[2023-06-01]

* Getting ready to release the live iso. The goal is to create Ragnarok's
own iso-building infrastructure with mmdebstrap + Makefiles, but for now
live-build will be used. Creating an infrastructure from scratch that is
as reliable as live-build will take some time and I have no desire to wait
until it's done before releasing an iso, especially considering that the
system is ready to use and waiting for real life testing.

* Even though live-build is being used for now, the mkiso script is being
replaced with a Makefile already. Once the new infrastructure is finished,
it'll be a simple question of replacing the live build stuff with the new
commands.
