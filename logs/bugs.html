Known Bugs in Ragnarok 01
=========================

* Firefox-esr crashes on first launch. It will start fine the second time
however.

This is most probably caused by hardened_malloc, as the crash does not occur
when it is disabled. 

This bug only affects firefox-esr, while the latest firefox provided by
mozilla does not seem to be affected.
