Known Bugs in Ragnarok 01
=========================

* Hardened_malloc causes Firefox-esr to crash on first launch. It will start
  fine the second time, however.

  This bug only affects firefox-esr, while the latest firefox provided by
  mozilla is not affected as it uses its own libraries.

* In the July 24 2023 build of the live iso, on some hardware (probably only
  on old machines), ttyS0 is respawning too fast causing the following error
  message:

  "init: Id "T0" respawning too fast: disabled for 5 minutes"

  This does not cause any real problems when booting in the default mode
  (live-x11), with the exception of the error message appearing when logging
  out of an X session. Although PS1 will disappear, typing startx then return
  will log back into X.

  Update on July 30th 2023: setting a lower speed only has the effect of making
  the error appear much later, but does not fix the issue. This may need to be
  investigated further, but considering that this only happens on old hardware
  from before 2010 (and the flash drive the ISO is on is almost as old), this
  is not a priority right now.

* Not a real bug, but should be mentioned here regardless: support for man-db
  has been removed. The reason: Ragnarok uses mandoc to provide /usr/bin/man,
  and there will be no compromise there. This, of course, clashes with Debian
  systems' expectation that man-db is the default.

  In order to not prevent packages that have a hard dependency on it to install,
  starting with the next iso a dummy man-db package will be provided to trick
  apt into thinking it's installed.

  Caveat: programs which need man-db to function (e.g. debhelper's dh_install)
  won't function properly. Luckily, such programs are pretty rare, and if you
  encounter a problem with a package that expects man-db, simply open an issue
  in the src[1] repository. 

  Note that Ragnarok's policy is to build deb packages inside a minimal chroot
  (which doesn't include a default 'man' implementation), so do not report issues
  with the devscripts and debhelper packages.

  If man-db is really needed, 'apt-get remove man-db && apt-get install man-db'
  will install the real package. This, however, will break mandoc, and you're on
  your own.
