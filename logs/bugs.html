Known Bugs in Ragnarok 01
=========================

* Kernel

  November 05, 2024 update: Whatever was causing the below kernel issue has been
  resolved. After months of testing, no kernel panic occured.

  December 15, 2023 update: The below kernel issue has revealed to be intermittent.
  From now on, a status for each kernel update will be provided.

  - All versions post-6.1.69: unaffected
  - 6.1.69: unaffected
  - 6.1.67: unaffected
  - 6.1.66: affected
  - 6.1.64: unaffected
  - All versions until (and including) 6.1.63: affected.

  Original bug:

  The Ragnarok flavour of the Linux kernel is a bit less forgiving of faulty
  hardware and/or poorly written modules, which may cause a kernel panic on
  some setups.

  I don't know what causes it precisely, however. The only thing confirmed is
  that I got a kernel panic on an old (2009), beaten down laptop, but not on
  the other hardware it was tested on.

  I can rule out Clang's CFI and ThinLTO as the cause, however, since the same
  kernel built without these features also panicked. The extra hardening options
  can also be pretty much ruled out since they never caused any issue on this
  specific device before. Same applies for the toolchain used (LLVM/Clang).

  In other words, it's currently a mystery why the kernel panics and the issue
  is still going to be investigated, but I do know it happens while loading the
  toshiba_acpi module (and may have to do with a faulty power button).

  Either way, the live ISO still includes the default Debian kernel and booting
  from it is as simple as selecting it in the grub menu, or if booting with
  isolinux, typing 'live-x11-debkernel' then hitting 'Return' at the boot
  prompt.

  Anyone encountering a kernel panic can let me know via the issue tracker on
  Github, or by sending an email to I-LeCorbeau(at)protonmail(dot)com. This
  would be rather helpful.

* In the July 24 2023 build of the live iso, on some hardware (probably only
  on old machines), ttyS0 is respawning too fast causing the following error
  message:

  "init: Id "T0" respawning too fast: disabled for 5 minutes"

  This does not cause any real problems when booting in the default mode
  (live-x11), with the exception of the error message appearing when logging
  out of an X session. Although PS1 will disappear, typing startx then return
  will log back into X.

  Update on July 30th 2023: setting a lower speed only has the effect of making
  the error appear much later, but does not fix the issue. This may need to be
  investigated further, but considering that this only happens on old hardware
  from before 2010 (and the flash drive the ISO is on is almost as old), this
  is not a priority right now.
