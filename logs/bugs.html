Known Bugs in Ragnarok 01
=========================

* Kernel

  December 11, 2023: the below issue can be considered fixed. After some tests,
  it turned out that it was enabling UBSAN and/or KASAN that caused the issue.
  Although I'd rather keep them enabled, they've been disabled for now. Since
  they're not enabled by default in the Debian kernel, keeping them off isn't
  that big of an issue, though.

  Original bug:

  The Ragnarok flavour of the Linux kernel is a bit less forgiving of faulty
  hardware and/or poorly written modules, which may cause a kernel panic on
  some setups.

  I don't know what causes it precisely, however. The only thing confirmed is
  that I got a kernel panic on an old (2009), beaten down laptop, but not on
  the other hardware it was tested on.

  I can rule out Clang's CFI and ThinLTO as the cause, however, since the same
  kernel built without these features also panicked. The extra hardening options
  can also be pretty much ruled out since they never caused any issue on this
  specific device before. Same applies for the toolchain used (LLVM/Clang).

  In other words, it's currently a mystery why the kernel panics and the issue
  is still going to be investigated, but I do know it happens while loading the
  toshiba_acpi module (and may have to do with a faulty power button).

  Either way, the live ISO still includes the default Debian kernel and booting
  from it is as simple as selecting it in the grub menu, or if booting with
  isolinux, typing 'live-x11-debkernel' then hitting 'Return' at the boot
  prompt.

  Anyone encountering a kernel panic can let me know via the issue tracker on
  Github, or by sending an email to I-LeCorbeau(at)protonmail(dot)com. This
  would be rather helpful.

* Hardened_malloc causes Firefox-esr to crash on first launch. It will start
  fine the second time, however.

* In the July 24 2023 build of the live iso, on some hardware (probably only
  on old machines), ttyS0 is respawning too fast causing the following error
  message:

  "init: Id "T0" respawning too fast: disabled for 5 minutes"

  This does not cause any real problems when booting in the default mode
  (live-x11), with the exception of the error message appearing when logging
  out of an X session. Although PS1 will disappear, typing startx then return
  will log back into X.

  Update on July 30th 2023: setting a lower speed only has the effect of making
  the error appear much later, but does not fix the issue. This may need to be
  investigated further, but considering that this only happens on old hardware
  from before 2010 (and the flash drive the ISO is on is almost as old), this
  is not a priority right now.

* Not a real bug, but should be mentioned here regardless: support for man-db
  has been removed. The reason: Ragnarok uses mandoc to provide /usr/bin/man,
  and there will be no compromise there. This, of course, clashes with Debian
  systems' expectation that man-db is the default.

  In order to not prevent packages that have a hard dependency on it to install,
  starting with the next iso a dummy man-db package will be provided to trick
  apt into thinking it's installed.

  Caveat: programs which need man-db to function (e.g. debhelper's dh_install)
  won't function properly. Luckily, such programs are pretty rare, and if you
  encounter a problem with a package that expects man-db, simply open an issue
  in the src[1] repository. 

  Note that Ragnarok's policy is to build deb packages inside a minimal chroot
  (which doesn't include a default 'man' implementation), so do not report issues
  with the devscripts and debhelper packages.

  If man-db is really needed, 'apt-get remove man-db && apt-get install man-db'
  will install the real package. This, however, will break mandoc, and you're on
  your own.
