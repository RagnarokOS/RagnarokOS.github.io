Known Bugs in Ragnarok 01
=========================

* Firefox-esr crashes on first launch. It will start fine the second time
  however.

  This is most probably caused by hardened_malloc, as the crash does not occur
  when it is disabled. 

  This bug only affects firefox-esr, while the latest firefox provided by
  mozilla is not affected as it uses its own libraries.

* In the July 24 2023 build of the live iso, on some hardware (probably only
  on old machines), ttyS0 is respawning too fast causing the following error
  message:

  "init: Id "T0" respawning too fast: disabled for 5 minutes"

  This does not cause any real problems when booting in the default mode
  (live-x11), with the exception of the error message appearing when logging
  out of an X session. Although PS1 will disappear, typing startx then return
  will log back into X.

  Update on July 30th 2023: setting a lower speed only has the effect of making
  the error appear much later, but does not fix the issue. This may need to be
  investigated further, but considering that this only happens on old hardware
  from before 2010 (and the flash drive the ISO is on is almost as old), this
  is not a priority right now.

The following bug was fixed in the July 30, 2023 build of the live iso:

* Exec bits were not set on the rcctl utility. Another bug that will be fixed
  in the next iso build. The temporary fix is to add them with the 'chmod 755'
  command if service management is needed.
